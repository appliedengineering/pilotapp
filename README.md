Windows video setup: https://youtu.be/8bXEM16MvEQ

However, before you watch the video, you must set up some of the larger software.
For Qt, check these options

For Visual Studio Community, check Desktop development with C++, then these options

Note: Do NOT check SDK 10.0.19041.0 as you are potentially subject to a very frustrating bug

For Visual Studio Build Tools, check Desktop development with C++, then these options

For environment variables, make sure you have paths to VScode bin, CMake bin, and your compiler's bin (MinGW for example)

VScode extensions: CMake Tools, C/C++, CMake, CMake Language Support

In the video you will see paths being modified in CMakeLists.txt. Use these in c_cpp_properties.json as well.
Your settings.json should look like this. Use Visual Studio 17 2022 as your generator; MinGW Makefiles should be a fallback in case.
```json
{
    "cmake.configureOnOpen": true,
    "cmake.sourceDirectory": "${workspaceFolder}/pilotapp",
    "cmake.cmakePath": "C:/CMake/bin/cmake",
    "cmake.generator": "Visual Studio 17 2022"
}
```
